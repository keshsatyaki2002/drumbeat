#Drumbeat System
This is a simple drumbeat system implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing keys on their keyboard.

#Getting Started
To use the drumbeat system, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You should see a grid of buttons representing different drum sounds.

#Usage
To play a sound, simply click on the corresponding button or press the key on your keyboard that corresponds to that sound. The following keys are mapped to different sounds:
W: Beat
A: bass drum
S: snare drum
D: hi-hat
K: snare
L: crash cymbal
J:Kick-bass
#Customization
If you'd like to customize the drumbeat system, you can modify the CSS and JavaScript files. The CSS file (style.css) contains the styling for the buttons and other elements of the system. The JavaScript file (script.js) contains the logic for playing sounds and handling user input.
